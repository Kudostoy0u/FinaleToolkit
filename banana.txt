Commands:
  adjust-wps             Adjusts raw Windowed Protection Score (WPS) by

  agg-bw                 Aggregates a bigWig signal over constant-length
                         intervals defined in a BED file.
  cleavage-profile       Calculates cleavage proportion over intervals defined
                         in a BED file based on alignment data from a
                         BAM/SAM/CRAM/Fragment file.
  coverage               Calculates fragmentation coverage over intervals
                         defined in a BED file based on alignment data from a
                         BAM/SAM/CRAM/Fragment file.
  filter-bam             Filters a BAM file for mapped read pairs meeting
                         specified criteria.
  frag-length-bins       Retrieves fragment lengths given a
                         BAM/SAM/CRAM/Fragment file.
  frag-length-intervals  Retrieves fragment length summary statistics over
                         intervals defined in a BED file based on alignment
                         data from a BAM/SAM/CRAM/Fragment file.
  wps                    Calculates Windowed Protection Score over intervals
                         defined in a BED file based on alignment data from a
                         BAM/SAM/CRAM/Fragment file.
